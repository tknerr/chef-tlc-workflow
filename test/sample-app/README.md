Description
===========

A minimal sample top-level cookbook for testing.

Requirements of a top-level cookbook:

 * strict dependency management - *all* dependency versions must be locked down in metadata.rb
 * Berksfile must exist and is *not* in .gitignore - we need it when resolving its dependencies
